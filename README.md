# Unsupervised-Learning
## DOMAIN: 
Automobile
### CONTEXT: 
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes <br />
### DATA DESCRIPTION: 
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon <br />
###  Attribute Information:
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders(cyl): multi-valued discrete
3. displacement(disp): continuous
4. horsepower(hp): continuous
5. weight(wt): continuous
6. acceleration(acc): continuous
7. model year(yr): multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance) <br/>

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict ‘mpg’
